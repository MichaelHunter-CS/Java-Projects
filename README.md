The data that the user enters will be through a GUI.

Steps to completing this project:

  Read the CSV file in Java
  
  Make a GUI that allows students to enter data
  
  Compare this data to the data in the CSV file
  
  Return to the user whether or not we predict that they will be an entrepreneur
