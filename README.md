# Java-Projects
INTRODUCTION
This repo is to store the contents of my summer assignment for OOP - Java.

Regarding the search engine the aim of this program is to act as a search engine for files. The user enters in a term that they would like to be searched and the program will return whether the given file contains the searched term. The program is also displayed to the user through a Graphical User Interface where the user just enters the files directory to which an example will be given below.

Example File Directory: C:\Users\Owner\Desktop\2nd Year Notes\Object Oriented Programming\testfile.txt

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The search engine has three main features:
1.	The user enters the file directory.
2.	The user enters the term that they want to be searched.
3.	The Graphical User Interface that is presented to the user.

EVALUATION METHODS
Read each option carefully as I origionally did the Machine Learning and wasted a majority of the allocated time on this assignment as I thought that it was the best option for me due to it primarily being probability - Time Management.
Rather than building the project outside of a Graphical User Interface and then trying to connect them afterwards just start with the Graphical User Interface.
Dedicate a seperate time to work on the assignment rather than trying to work on multiple assignments at a time - Time Management.
Look into Github rather than just adding a file and posting it here like its a forum.
